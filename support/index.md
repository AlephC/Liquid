# Stuck?
If you need help there are a few ways you can connect with the team and seek out assistance.

## Mailing List
We strongly suggest that you subscribe to our low-volume mailing list to get useful (and timely) information.

To sign up, send an email to LISTSERV@lists.research.microsoft.com with a one-line body reading:<br><br>
```
SUB Liquid-news FirstName LastName
```
<br><br>
Replacing FirstName and LastName with your first and last names.
If you prefer to remain anonymous, you may instead send an email containing:<br><br>
```
SUB Liquid-news anonymous
```

## GitHub
Posting an issue at [the GitHub site](http://github.com/StationQ/Liquid/issues) is a good way to get the attention of the development team as well as the user community. In many cases, you may be able to find the answer to your question in issues that have been previously answered.

## E-mail
Sending mail to liquid(at)microsoft.com will get the attention of the entire team (please use sparingly).

## Twitter
We currently do not have a Twitter account set up specifically for LIQ&#x1D448;&#x1D456;&#x23D0;&#x232A;, however if you tag a post with #QuArC (or flag @DaveWecker), I promise to read it ;)
